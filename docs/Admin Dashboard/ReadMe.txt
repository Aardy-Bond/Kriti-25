Admin Dashboard - Digital Identity Management 

Overview 

The Admin Dashboard serves as the central system for managing user registrations, document approvals, and digital identity (DID) creation. It facilitates interaction between users and the government, ensuring secure identity verification and storage on IPFS while leveraging blockchain technology to generate changeable NFTs as digital identities. 

Workflow 

User Registration and Document Upload:
Users register through the admin dashboard and upload their required documents. 
Government Approval Process:
The uploaded documents are automatically sent to the government for verification. 
Upon successful verification, the user receives a notification confirming their registration approval. 
Metamask Wallet and Digital Identity Creation:
Once approved, the user sets a password for their generated Metamask wallet address. 
The user's DID, along with their approved document details, is securely uploaded to IPFS. 
NFT-Based Digital Identity:
A dynamic NFT is created representing the user's Digital Identity (DID). 
This NFT remains modifiable, allowing updates when necessary. 


Technologies Used:

Blockchain & Smart Contracts: Ensures secure identity verification and NFT creation. 
IPFS (InterPlanetary File System): Decentralized storage for document and identity details. 
Metamask Wallet: Secure wallet integration for digital identity transactions. 
NFTs: Changeable non-fungible tokens as a form of Digital Identity. 
Automated Notifications: Real-time updates for user status changes. 

Features:

Seamless User Registration: Intuitive interface for document submission. 
Secure Document Verification: Government approval process for identity validation. 
Decentralized Identity Storage: DID and document details stored on IPFS. 
Dynamic NFT Generation: Changeable NFT serving as the userâ€™s Digital Identity. 
Metamask Wallet Integration: Password-protected user wallet for transactions. 
Automated Notifications: Keeps users informed at each stage of the process. 

Future Enhancements: 

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for added security. 
Integration with Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) for governance. 
AI-based Document Verification for automated validation processes. 
Cross-platform Compatibility to support multiple blockchain ecosystems. 


This Admin Dashboard ensures a seamless and secure digital identity management system by leveraging blockchain and decentralized storage solutions.
